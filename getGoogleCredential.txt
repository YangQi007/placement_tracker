How to Get Google API Credentials for Google Sheets Export
To enable Google Sheets export, you need a credentials.json file from Google Cloud. Hereâ€™s how to get it:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. Create a New Project (or select an existing one)
Click the project dropdown at the top.
Click New Project.
Give it a name (e.g., Placement Tracker) and click Create.

3. Enable Google Sheets API
With your project selected, go to APIs & Services > Library.
Search for Google Sheets API.
Click it, then click Enable.

4. Enable Google Drive API
In the same API Library, search for Google Drive API.
Click it, then click Enable.

5. Create OAuth Client ID Credentials
Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
Click + Create Credentials > OAuth client ID.
If prompted, configure the consent screen (set the app name, support email, and add yourself as a test user).
For Application type, select Desktop app.
Name it (e.g., Placement Tracker Desktop).
Click Create.

6. Download the Credentials
After creation, click Download JSON.
Save the file as credentials.json in the same folder as your application.

7, Add Yourself as a Test User
On the setup page, -> APIs & Services -> OAuth consent screen -> Audience.
Click Add Users.
Enter your Google account email address (and any others who will test the app).
Click Save and Continue.
Only users listed here will be able to authorize the app while it is in testing mode.

7. First-Time Use
The first time you export to Google Sheets, a browser window will open for you to log in and authorize access.
After authorization, a token.pickle file will be created for future use.
Keep your credentials.json file safe and do not share it publicly.
